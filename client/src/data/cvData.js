export const aboutText = `I completed my studies at Dokuz Eylül University, specializing in Public Administration, in 2018.
Following a series of short-term sales roles, I experienced a period of unemployment due to my involvement 
in the airline second pilot nomination process and some health issues. Presently residing in Mersin, Turkey, 
I am employed as a remote Live Support Representative for an IT company based in Zagreb. In pursuit of a career change, 
I enrolled in the Data Science Bootcamp at Istanbul Data Science Academy in June 2023, successfully completing the program 
in January 2024. After completing my Data Science training in January this year, I tried to further develop myself in the same 
field. Finally, in March, I requested my company to start me in a data-related position. Unfortunately, my request was denied 
on the grounds that I did not have enough experience for such a position and that just having training would not be sufficient. 
However, they must have noticed my efforts to improve myself and my eagerness to continuously learn, as they made me another 
offer. They promised to start me as a Junior Web Developer if I successfully completed the training they planned for me. 
Working in a data-related position was not a promise I made to myself. Starting in any position that required coding skills 
would be a significant step for my career. Therefore, I couldn’t refuse this offer, which made me the happiest among the offers 
I’ve received in my life. To become a Junior Web Developer, I started the famous Angela Yu’s “The Complete 2024 Web Development 
Bootcamp” from The App Brewery and it is still ongoing.`;
